This is a WIP app for creating chord charts. It's a songwriting tool that allows musicians to quickly create chord charts for songs with notes for each section of a song. It's for folks who don't want full notation of parts, but just want to keep a record of the chords being used in each section of a song.

It was my first React app. Currently it stores data in local storage, but when I get some time I'd like to add a backend service to store everything in a database. I'd also like to improve the state managment. It works as-is, but it's definitely stretching the limits of readability.
